# CliSample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

# ModalModule

This project was designed to show a working example of a modal module. The idea with a modal module is all modals in a project live in the module and are called and created through a modal service. The modal module makes all modals available to the entire application. 

The modal module lives in the modules/modal folder and the load modal used as the example lives in the modules/modal/components folder. All logic to show the load modal is located in the app.component ngOnInit() function.
