# CliSample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

# ModalModule

This project was designed to show a working example of a modal module. The idea with a modal module is all modals in a project live in the module and are called and created through a modal service. The modal module makes all modals available to the entire application. 

The modal module lives in the modules/modal folder and the load modal used as the example lives in the modules/modal/components folder. All logic to show the load modal is located in the app.component ngOnInit() function.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
